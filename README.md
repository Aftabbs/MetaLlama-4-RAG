# MetaLlama-4-RAG
This project integrates Meta's Llama 4 Scout model with a RAG framework to enhance the model's performance by incorporating external knowledge sources. The application utilizes Faiss for vector database management, Gradio for the user interface, Groq for low-latency LLM inference, and Sentence Transformers for efficient text embeddings.
